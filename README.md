# daily-planner

## Author

## Summary
The purpose of this project was to create a daily planner that had boxes for every work hour of the day. Within each box, the user is able to type out an activity or event (text) into the box and click a save button in order to store the text locally, so that upon refresh, it is still available and visible. Additional functionality includes the constantly updating background colors for each text box that, depending on the current time, are grey for hours passed, red for current hours, and green for future hours. A time and date are available at the top of the page, constantly updating as well.
